## My Personal DotFiles for Local and Remote Servers

Welcome to my personal dotfiles, this project is intended to provide myself with a familiar standard jumping off point for my ubuntu servers and machines for use as a standard starting point.

The project is very barebones at the moment as I decide what is most important to me and implement it. Feel free to utilize as is or fork to customize for yourself. Please keep in mind I also utilize this project to implent new ideas for BASH/ZSH scripts and while I test in my local environment somethings may break.

## TO-DO

[ ] Gist bast install script for first run.
[ ] Update script based on what's important to me to ensure is always up to date.
[ ] Makes things a bit nicer looking via styling, log messages, etc.
[ ] More to come...

## Requirements

To utilize this project you should only need access to git and eventually curl to run the install script.
